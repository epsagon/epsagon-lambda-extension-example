# Epsagon AWS Lambda Extension

This repository contains an example of how to use the new [Epsagon extension for AWS Lambda runtime](https://epsagon.com/development/aws-lambda-extension/).

With the release of the new extension, Epsagon enables developers to reduce the overhead of distributed tracing and improve performance while still gaining full visibility into their serverless application.
